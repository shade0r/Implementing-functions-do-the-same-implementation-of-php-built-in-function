## Implement functions do the same implementation of php built in functions.


---
### In this repo I try to simulate implementation of php built in function by creating my personal function that do the same thing, I do that for improving my logic and problem solving skill.

>To test this code you should have php of 7.x.x version of higher installed in you system as old versions don't support some features like define which datatype that function will return.
